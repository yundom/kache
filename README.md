A library to provide runtime in-memory cache, with options of LRU and FIFO.
## Installation
Include the library in your `build.gradle`
```
compile 'com.yundom:kache:0.0.3'
```

## Usage
Kache has a very simple builder for you to configure and create cache instance. 
Create a cache instance:
		val cache = Builder.build<Int, String>()
Then you will get:
1. A cache instance with key of type `Int`, and value of type `String`.
2. Default capacity is `128`.
3. Default cache policy is `LRU`.

Create a FIFO cache instance with capacity of 32:
```kotlin
val cache = Builder.build<Int, String>({
    policy = FIFO
    capacity = 32
})
```

Put an entry into the cache:
```kotlin
cache.put(1, "Hello")  // [1 to "Hello"]
cache.put(2, "World") // [1 to "Hello", 2 to "World"]
```

Get an entry from the cache:
```kotlin
cache.get(1)  // return the value "Hello"
```

Return null if the key does not exist.
```kotlin
cache.get(4) // return null
```

Remove an entry from the cache:
```kotlin
cache.remove(1) // remove the entry then return the removed value "Hello"
```

Clear the cache:
```kotlin
kache.clear()
```
